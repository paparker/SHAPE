# SHAPE

This repository can be used to batch score soil SOC data using the SHAPE method. This is based on [The soil health assessment protocol and evaluation applied to soil organic C](https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/saj2.20244) (Please cite this article as [https://doi.org/10.1002/saj2.20244](https://doi.org/10.1002/saj2.20244)) by MÃ¡rcio R. Nunes,  Kristen S. Veum,  Paul A. Parker,  Scott H. Holan,  Douglas L. Karlen,  Joseph P. Amsili, Harold M. van Es,  Skye A. Wills,  Cathy A. Seybold, and Thomas B. Moorman.

The `dataIn.csv` file can be replaced with your own soil data, using the same format. Then, the R file `Batch_Score.R` can be run to generate scores.
